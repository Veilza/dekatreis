After the era known as the Departure of the Demigods, foreseeing chaos to fall over the world without a coherent leader, a child of one of the Demigods rose to power and took control, calling herself “The Queen.” Creating 5 distinct kingdoms–Azor, Akiira, Totara, Sarille, and Dekatreis–The Queen placed princes and princesses in charge to rule autonomously while stepping into the shadows, relying on those who she chose to act.</p><h3>The Current Time</h3><p>Through the years of the Queen’s rule, there have been many conflicts. The kingdoms of Sarille, Dekatreis, and Akiira went to war–ending with the utter destruction of the kingdom of Akiira through magical corruption, enabling a new kingdom, Arcadia, to grow from parts of the ruins. The kingdom of Azor split into two, causing the Southern continent to become Azoranthium. The Queen’s necessity to step in to resolve the conflicts yet always too late has lead many to question her authority, but always in whispered breaths.</p><p>All the while, sinister forces attempt to dig their nails into an unstable world, often leaving the citizens of each kingdom to take care of the messes themselves while the Princes and Princesses struggle to maintain power over in a world where their Queen has drifted into silence.</p>","actors":[],"combats":[],"items":[],"journal":[{"_id":"0PBfpOiGfwSwr22o","name":"Guide","folder":"v5xaHMOI0nvdOppu","sort":100000,"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"type":"base","scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"}},"pages":[{"name":"Guide","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Orange = Major Landmarks [#FFA500]</p>\n<p>Yellow = Capital Cities [#FFFF00]</p>\n<p>Green = Non-Capital Cities (Population &gt;5000) [#00FF00]</p>\n<p>Dark Green = Villages (Population &lt;5000) [#03DC8B]</p>\n<p>Blue = Oceans [#4D4DFF]</p>\n<p>Cyan = Lakes [#00FFFF]</p>\n<p>Brown = Mountains [#C16100]</p>"},"_id":"PjLzprQO30elgeRb","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":"12.324","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null,"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"lZMmCOPpq3QSpsO7":3,"ZCJq0jCW0lLDyZ9Y":3,"NDTSsIQdPftAPxqd":3,"zftoxujJlO1zG8i1":3,"4dlZDReZ0Yzm0hqr":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"5.0.1","coreVersion":"12.324","createdTime":1677825942461,"modifiedTime":1687032627969,"lastModifiedBy":"Ip5sxjIRA2aGUX04","compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null}},{"_id":"C4vDUpFjRgHqEQKv","name":"Lake Sylvis","folder":"czq10j870JFxkpYU","sort":100000,"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"type":"poi","scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}","location":"Akiira","lZMmCOPpq3QSpsO7":{"notes":""}}},"pages":[{"name":"Lake Sylvis","type":"image","src":"modules/dekatreis/assets/images/poi.png","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"_id":"DZCbtHBI5MPXj6xV","image":{},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":"12.324","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null,"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"lZMmCOPpq3QSpsO7":3,"ZCJq0jCW0lLDyZ9Y":3,"NDTSsIQdPftAPxqd":3,"zftoxujJlO1zG8i1":3,"4dlZDReZ0Yzm0hqr":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"5.0.1","coreVersion":"12.324","createdTime":1677825942462,"modifiedTime":1687032627969,"lastModifiedBy":"Ip5sxjIRA2aGUX04","compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null}},{"_id":"8R64laL8S27RIFni","name":"The Grand Arena","folder":"kEGlSxA9cTalpCv1","sort":0,"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"type":"poi","scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"}},"pages":[{"name":"The Grand Arena","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a>\n<p>While many demigod artefacts have been hidden away, the one that maintains prevalence in daily society is the Book of Creation.

However, knowing its abuse would cause mass hysteria, she instead began to host a bi-yearly game: The Grand Arena.</p>\n<p>Every two years, the Princess of Azor would ask for people all across the world to register to fight in the arena. Hundreds of thousands would apply, but only the most skilled and luckiest thousand would be accepted to participate in a grand-scale multi-attributed tournament to prove their worth against all the other competitors. Whether in teams or going in solo, the potential prize was worth the risk of death, which was assured should one lose enough times.</p>\n<p>The prize itself: One use of the Book of Creation, the ability to create any creature that they wished, with almost no limits. The limits, however, were not from the book but from Princess Rosalia herself, to ensure that no one destroyed the world. Besides that, throughout the years, she watched many adventurers battle each other, spill blood and gore, only to reach the end and ask for a variety of things. A re-creation of their loved ones who passed away, a Kathari to keep as a slave, a Mindflayer to study and test on, and even a young Shadow Dragon that would come to be known as an infamous adventurer’s steed.</p>\n<p>When Rosalia III passed on, Rosalia IV picked up the mantle and continued the games, changing almost none of the rules when she saw how much entertainment it brought to the people of her land.

The city's silver mines have long been a source of wealth and prosperity, attracting miners and traders from all corners of the world. But Silverhaven is more than just a mining town – it's a melting pot of cultures and traditions, where people of all backgrounds come to exchange ideas and experiences. One of the city's greatest attractions are the stunning auroras that frequently light up the night sky, drawing visitors from far and wide to witness their beauty. The city's architecture reflects its diverse influences, blending together styles from different eras and cultures to create a unique and vibrant urban landscape. With its bustling markets, lively entertainment scene, and welcoming atmosphere, Silverhaven is a city that has something for everyone.</p><hr /><h3>Current Government</h3><p>The city's government is made up of an elected council with no central mayor; every member of the council must vote on upcoming laws and decrees, which are discussed weekly and are in full view of the city's populace if they so wish to sit in.</p><p>Every five years, the council is put up for re-election, though campaigning isn't often done. As the elections for the council come up, the members of the city look back at the individuals currently in council as well as the other prominent members of the community, then every permanent resident of the city is allowed to write down up to five names and rank them from 1 to 5 on their preference for each of their chosen persons. Every name and choice is put into a \"pile,\" and the slots are filled from the most popular down until all the council's slots are filled.</p><p>Public debates are common, and it's written into the city of SIlverhaven's constitution that should a tie ever come about (either from an even number of council seats or one of the council members being unavailable for a vote), the attending city populace at the time will have a vote to break the tie.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Current Council Members</span></strong></span></p><ul><li>Lirielle Windwhisper [NG F elf rogue 4] is a charismatic and quick-witted elf who values the freedom of the city's citizens above all else.</li><li>Drogan Ironbeard [LN M dwarf champion 5] is a stern and uncompromising dwarf who believes in upholding the law and punishing those who break it.</li><li>Amara Songsteel [CG F human bard 3] is a talented musician and performer who uses her charm and wit to sway the council towards decisions that benefit the people.</li><li>Xanathar Flamecaller [CN NB dragonborn sorcerer 2] is an enigmatic dragonborn who is more interested in personal power and wealth than the city's welfare, often causing tension among the council.</li><li>Kaelen Nightwing [LE M aasimar fighter 6] is a strict and authoritarian aasimar who believes that the city needs a strong hand to maintain order and discipline.</li><li>Elaith Craulnober [NE M dark elf wizard 3] is a dark and mysterious dark elf who often keeps to himself and has an unsettling presence, causing many to distrust him.</li><li>Tazmikella Stonefist [N F gnome druid 4] is a kind and gentle gnome who is passionate about protecting the environment and ensuring the city's sustainability for future generations.</li></ul>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"5.9.3","coreVersion":"12.324","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1707196758358,"lastModifiedBy":"Ip5sxjIRA2aGUX04","compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null}},{"sort":0,"name":"City Gate","type":"text","_id":"XRqmxEt5ipKUMrUn","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>Silverhaven has three city gates, each made of thick stone and reinforced with iron bars.

Additionally, with its easy access to the forests to the south, Hero's Reach grew plentifully with hunters, gatherers, druids, and soon an entire city began to form.</p><p>The city's population exploded with a proper, small government forming and introducing trading contracts to get residents the supplies from nearby cities they needed, as well as beginning a massive export program of wood, fish, and meat.</p><p>With such plentiful trade creating an economic fervor around the tip of the peninsula, @UUID[.fD28Wbk2QN39Hki6]{The Docks} were built to properly allow trading ships to be built and boarded, and a lighthouse soon followed after once enough ships had accidentally crashed into the new docks.</p><hr /><h3>Current Government</h3><p>The city's government is comprised of an elected mayor and several representatives from the official guilds around the city. Each mayoral tenure lasts for 6 years, and comes with the full power to oversee the city's trading contracts and propose votes for new city laws, which then get put on a yearly ballot. If the proposed law passes in two consecutive ballots, it is added to the city's lawbook.</p><p>As part of a condition in order to become an official city guild and have sway within city politics, each of the current representatives are elected every 10 years. Despite the long tenure, a new election may be triggered at the whim of the population, if more than 40% of the current residents of the city write the mayor to remove one of the current acting guild representatives.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Current Mayor</span></strong></span> (<em>as of 949 QY</em>): Morella Sevestra</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Current Guild Representatives</span></strong></span></p><ul><li><p>@UUID[.Oy7nNLO6KSFb3rTB]{Adventurer's Guild}: Fourteen Distant Flames</p></li><li><p>@UUID[.oo3SnmgRm1wJ3UTE]{Fighter's Guild}: Jade Cartwright</p></li><li><p>@UUID[.Z4iEY3NfM00Cy1gt]{Artisan's Guild}: Aradayl Rythian</p></li><li><p>@UUID[.bKQWl1BygSGZL5Ir]{Thief's Guild}: Syralye Sharondalan</p></li><li><p>@UUID[.fCxzQOt2wdq4UamD]{Mage's Guild}: Thelanyn Ratsu'skalyn</p></li></ul><p></p><hr /><h3>Quick Timeline</h3><ul><li><p>The first settlers of the region came and began building housing around the year 806 QY.</p></li><li><p>The city of Hero's Reach was officially founded in the year 824 QY.</p></li></ul>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"5.4.4","coreVersion":"12.324","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1694091265708,"lastModifiedBy":"Ip5sxjIRA2aGUX04","compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null}},{"sort":1250000,"name":"University","type":"text","_id":"3Yc5YP9PnpBS9jhY","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p></p><p></p><h2>Notable Members</h2><ul><li><p>- Current representative to the city council.</p></li></ul><p></p><h2>University Benefit</h2><p>As part of the University, its members will periodically be called upon to do tasks for the school.

It consists of 20 magitech train cars that are carefully coordinated and maintained to ensure the smooth operation of the railway. The railway is primarily used for exporting and importing products and transporting people across the kingdoms.</p><p>The project was initiated by Thallan Presthana, who utilized her new necromantic and robotic workforce to construct and maintain the railway. This allowed her to offload dangerous and straining work from her mortal citizens to those who had already used up their life or had no life to begin with. The use of this workforce was controversial at first, but the efficiency and effectiveness of the railway soon won over many skeptics.</p><p>The Grand Railway has had a significant impact on the economies of the three kingdoms. It has opened up new markets for goods and services and has allowed for greater communication and exchange of ideas between the kingdoms. The railway has also made it easier for people to travel between the kingdoms, allowing for increased tourism and cultural exchange.</p><p>Despite its successes, The Grand Railway has not been without its challenges. The maintenance and repair of the magitech train cars require specialized knowledge and expertise, which can be difficult to find and train. Additionally, some have raised concerns about the potential environmental impact of the railway and its effects on local wildlife.</p><p>Overall, The Grand Railway has been a major achievement in inter-kingdom cooperation and infrastructure development. It has transformed the way that goods and people move throughout Dekatreis, Sarille, and Totara, and has contributed to the growth and prosperity of the three kingdoms.</p></div></div></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":"12.324","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null,"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"lZMmCOPpq3QSpsO7":3,"ZCJq0jCW0lLDyZ9Y":3,"NDTSsIQdPftAPxqd":3,"zftoxujJlO1zG8i1":3,"4dlZDReZ0Yzm0hqr":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"5.0.1","coreVersion":"12.324","createdTime":1677825942530,"modifiedTime":1687032627969,"lastModifiedBy":"Ip5sxjIRA2aGUX04","compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null}},{"folder":"R8vhbpBTerpJ2uDV","name":"Arvandor","pages":[{"sort":100000,"name":"The Region of Arvandor","type":"text","_id":"Bk069LygWY3Yd31E","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":"12.324","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null,"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null}}],"sort":300000,"ownership":{"default":0,"ZCJq0jCW0lLDyZ9Y":3,"ywVvxMVArTa4nncx":3,"NDTSsIQdPftAPxqd":3,"zftoxujJlO1zG8i1":3,"4dlZDReZ0Yzm0hqr":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"5.0.1","coreVersion":"12.324","createdTime":1678267893464,"modifiedTime":1687032627969,"lastModifiedBy":"Ip5sxjIRA2aGUX04","compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null},"_id":"pcs66Ap4aOz7mHoF"},{"_id":"uIsYGvJ0nRLzhu7O","name":"Titania's Rest","folder":"R8vhbpBTerpJ2uDV","sort":100000,"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"type":"poi","location":"Totara","lZMmCOPpq3QSpsO7":{"notes":""},"scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}"}},"pages":[{"name":"Titania's Rest","type":"image","src":"modules/dekatreis/assets/images/poi.png","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"_id":"5sflLnm9uJEBier0","image":{},"text":{"format":1},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"system":{},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":"12.324","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null,"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null}}],"ownership":{"default":2,"lZMmCOPpq3QSpsO7":3,"ZCJq0jCW0lLDyZ9Y":3,"NDTSsIQdPftAPxqd":3,"zftoxujJlO1zG8i1":3,"4dlZDReZ0Yzm0hqr":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"5.0.1","coreVersion":"12.324","createdTime":1677825942530,"modifiedTime":1687032627969,"lastModifiedBy":"Ip5sxjIRA2aGUX04","compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null}},{"_id":"uVYNJl2mkFvLKmoB","name":"Arvanvos Desert","folder":"R8vhbpBTerpJ2uDV","sort":200000,"flags":{"monks-enhanced-journal":{"type":"poi","scrollPos":"{\".description\":0}","location":"Totara","lZMmCOPpq3QSpsO7":{"notes":""}}},"pages":[{"name":"Arvanvos Desert","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>The gigantic desert that marks the territory of the Totara kingdom is inhabited by the wandering tribes of Totarans as well as the mysterious creatures that seem to strike from the sands.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Additionally, roaming the desert is an eternal, 400-kilometre wide Elemental Storm that strengthens and weakens seemingly randomly.
