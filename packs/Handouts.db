Every single race was made by her, some were changed in some way, others were invented, and many kept their usual form as they were on Toril. Kavara has much work to do, but over nearly 900 years, she accomplished creating a flourishing ecosystem using her knowledge of nature and the Book of Creation. This also allowed me to normalize pretty much every single race I could think of, from both Toril and any other settings I wished to take ideas from. With the Book of Creation, there was no limit.</p><p>During this phase, I was also able to reason out new races that you’ll find in Dekatreis: The Magia, the Petona, and the Kathari. These are all subraces of humans that were created with the Book of Creation. Curious to see the extent that they could manipulate life, the demigods convinced Kavara to put wings on a human. With enough tweaking, she gave humans flight in the forms of the Petona. Then they wished to put more magic inside a human from birth, like the innate magic of elves. She granted them random boons of magical energy that was attached to their blood, and these were called Magia.</p><p>Then came the question: Could the demigods make their own children? The answer, Kavara came up with, was no. The book told her many things, and one of these things was all the magic that they had abused with their godly artefacts had corrupted their bodies, forcing them to never have children. But, Kavara did offer to create children for the demigods and their spouses. In order to set their children apart from all the other species, she would combine what she had done with the Petona and Magia, and she would combine them into one body, and give features from both parents to make it appear like their own. These, she decided, would be Kathari. Kathari would be the children of demigods who had the full ability to breed more Kathari, and with their powerful blood they would have wings and magic that surpassed the Magia’s and Petona’s capabilities.</p></div><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>Creation of the Continents</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>Dekatreis quickly ran out of room on the tiny island within the first year. So, of course, another two artefacts helped remedy this. Vondal, a dwarf, had an artefact that allowed him to create land from nothing and, while this rose the sea levels, he could raise the land some to balance it all out. With the help of Nasir, who held the Heavenly Robes that allowed him to manipulate the weather before things turned chaotic from the sudden change in sea level and land mass, Vondal was able to create the continents until the demigods were happy. To add in variety, Loriella, a gnome, also helped re-shape the lands, adding in deserts, arctic areas, forests, and more–all using her own artefact, the Talisman of True Transmutation.</p></div><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>Society Develops</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>After plenty of varieties of creatures were made, and the landmasses were properly designed, the only thing the demigods had to do was watch over their creation to see how it did. Kavara continued creating new species, all with their own free will but most choosing to worship the demigods as true gods for their ability to create such a vast and amazing world on their own. History books were made detailing all their feats and accomplishments, then it was transferred to digital servers with the help of Cecelia, who wielded a ring that could create any piece of technological equipment so long as she knew how the inner workings worked.</p><p>With the ring, Cecelia was also able to help the people make blueprints of all this technology, explain to them what resources they’d need, how to refine it all. They digitized all this information as well, giving them a running start on the techno-fantasy setting that I wanted to have in this setting. Technology and magic wouldn’t compete, but it would grow together.</p><p>Soon, cities began to spring up and a little bit of order was fashioned, but none of the demigods wished to create governments or help the mortals create them. They thought that would be overstepping boundaries when during the last thousand years, all they wanted to do was watch over and see how their creation did on its own.</p></div><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>Departure of the Demigods</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>1500 years after the demigods had first stepped foot on the world of Dekatreis, and after seeing how far it had all grown and how far it had left to go, some of the demigods began to speak of leaving the physical aspect of the world. The first to go through with this was Tyrae Valsh, the drow that wielded an artefact called the Apple of Discordia. He stated that ever since the beginning, he wished to reach godhood, and he believed that creating a world would grant him such a right. However, despite a number of drow followers, he didn’t find the divine power he sought through their worship. Thus, he vanished into the realms of the Shadowfell, and was from there never heard from again.</p><p>Across the next 1000 years, the rest of the demigods began to slowly depart for various reasons. Keishara claimed her own layer of the abyss, Loriella and Vondal went back to Faerun to be home together again, and many of the demigods actually ascended to godhood, such as Cecelia, who became the goddess of technology.</p><p>The last one to leave the world was Alethra Stormchild, the wielder of an artefact called the Staff of Pure Order. He had a Kathari child named Viessa, and after hiding away his staff, he told Viessa that she could find it and have rightful claim to all its power if she could retrieve it. If she could not, then he relayed to her his fear that the world might fall into chaos without the demigods on it.</p></div><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>The Queen's Years Begin</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>Finally, we’re back to the Queen, Viessa Stormchild. After going on a long string of adventures searching for her father’s Staff of Pure Order, she eventually reached it and felt its power in her grasp. Immediately, she knew what the artefact could be used for. It had two abilities:</p><ul><li><p>Order: Your very presence with this staff causes those who can hear or see you to trust you and follow your whim. You may utter a verbal component and any living or nonliving creature that can hear you is forced to believe or follow your utterences to the best of their abilities.</p></li><li><p>Universal Speech: Your voice booms through the head of every living, conscious creature in the material plane of the world. This penetrates magical barriers and anti-magic fields. You may reduce the radius of this effect using a specified range, such as 10 miles, or using a qualifier, such as the entire kingdom of Dekatreis.</p></li></ul><p>The power that this staff had was almost corrupting, and recalling it, she began to realise why she had never seen her father with the staff in hand. However, she heard his last words in her head again, how the world could fall into chaos and tear itself apart without someone to guide it. So, with the power of the staff, she combined its two abilities. She spoke to the entire world at once, and forced them to obey. She ordered that she would be their Queen, and that there would be no resistance to her claim, as she was the child of Alethra Stormchild, and she had a right to bring the world into a new era of order.</p></div><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>New Order</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>Viessa split the world into five kingdoms: Dekatreis, Sarille, Totara, Azor, and Akiira. She placed princes and princesses in control of each kingdom, and trusted them with maintaining order. To ensure this, she would regularly hold meetings between each of the princes and princesses, send diplomats from her court to check on their people, and she, herself, would go out and walk the streets of the kingdoms to interact with the commoners.</p></div><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>War of the Five Elves</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>This went well for some years, until the War of the Five Elves began. You see, she put the Sun and Moon Elves–creations from the Book of Creation–in charge of Akiira, she put the Dark Elves in control of Sarille, and she put the Wood and High Elves in charge of Dekatreis. These elf groups made efforts to be interconnected and promised each other to share magical research and discoveries with each other no matter what. However, it all fell apart when word reached Dekatreis that the leader of Sarille had obtained an artefact, and had kept it a secret.</p><p>The Prince of Sarille one day found spies in his tower attempting to gain information on this supposed artefact. In fury, he brought the Dekatrian spies out in front of his tower and executed them both, declaring the pact between the three kingdoms ‘destroyed’ and putting full blame on Dekatreis. Dekatreis quickly declared war on Sarille, and Akiira joined the war shortly later on the side of Dekatreis.</p><p>During this time, the Queen had left her tower on a mission, and so she was unaware as this war waged on between the three middle kingdoms. Dirty tactics were employed by Sarille, as the Prince finally revealed which artefact he had: Discordia’s Apple.</p><p>With Discordia’s Apple, the Prince of Sarille was able to “take a bite out of this regenerative apple and speak a verbal component that is under 25 words. All creatures that hear these words spoken, even by second hand, are compelled to see these words as the truth. If it is a command, they must follow the command to the best of their abilities, becoming otherwise mindless until the attunement to the apple ends.” With this power, the Prince took a bite of the apple and told his men that no one should trust the rulers of Akiira, that the Sun and Moon Elves were simply putting their own territory into a crisis and that they had no right to be in the war in the first place. However, when word reached the ears of the Akiirans, something much more grave happened than just forcing Akiira to step out of the war.</p><p>The common people of Akiira turned on their leaders as the words were spread rapidly across the territory, and not only their leaders, but the Sun and Moon Elf races themselves. Over the course of five years, Akiira was brought into absolute chaos, and the Sun and Moon Elves were slaughtered to near extinction with very few escaping the minds corrupted by Discordia’s Apple.</p><p>With Akiira in shambles, Sarille was able to put all of their focus on fighting their war against Dekatreis, but they were still taking heavier losses than their counterpart. The Prince of Sarille took another bite of the apple, and repeated the same corrupting message to be sent to Dekatreis. Before long, the commoners of Dekatreis began to second guess their leaders as well, but not before the Queen returned and, with fury in her gaze, ordered all the princes and princesses–save for Akiira’s, who had been murdered by their own people–to her court.</p></div><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>Aftermath of the War</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>After a speedy trial, the Prince of Sarille had his artefact taken from him by force, ending his attunement before the kingdom of Dekatreis fell into as much chaos as Akiira had fallen into. The Queen locked the artefact in her vault, making sure it could not be abused any more. Afterwards, she locked the Prince in a prison below her tower on Queen’s Island, where not a soul heard from him again.</p><p>From there, she surveyed Akiira and realised that there was no saving the kingdom. The chaos it had been put through left the land magically corrupted, with portals to other planes conjuring from nothing and terrifying creatures of twisted forms attacking anything that dared get close to them.</p><p>During Sarille’s war, a foreigner had gained popularity among the non-Dark Elves of Sarille, encouraging them to stage an uprising to end the war. By the time they were about to go through with their plans, however, the Queen had ended the war herself, and now the throne was empty. The foreigner was named Thallan Pesthana, and used her influence to convince the Queen that she would make a good next ruler for the kingdom. Many of the Dark Elves had been excommunicated from society, pushed away due to what the Dark Elf Prince had done. Many began to shame the population with the word “Drow,” harassing them and sometimes using violence until many of the Dark Elves took seclusion in setting up their own cities to hide away from all the hatred the other races had gained for them. Though Dekatreis did not have typical Drow at the time, they were called such until one day the influence of Lolth swept in and she began to corrupt the world’s Dark Elves as well.</p><p> </p><p>For additional reading on the history of the world after the War of the Five Elves, see @UUID[.Ox11ew3xCpkT1u7h]{Modern History}</p></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"gVxGX70lxArmMULn","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":100000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":"12.324","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null,"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null}},{"name":"Seasons","type":"text","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>The six seasons of Dekatreis are spread out through the year, beginning with calm, warm weather, transitioning into rainy and storming seasons, and finishing the year with a cold snap.</p><h3>Calm Winds</h3><p>Calm Winds include the months of <strong>Order</strong> and <strong>Aura</strong>.

Conjuring intense winds, ocean storms, and even tsunamis, many people that were once profiting from the dangerous allure of wealth that could be profited from the risk during the season of Dangerous Waves wouldn't dare chance an encounter with the Great Viper and the terrifying storms that follow in its wake.</p><h3>Intense Chills</h3><p>True to the name, and stretching across three long months--<strong>Betrayal</strong>, <strong>Shadows</strong>, and <strong>Fear</strong>--this is the time where most of the planet experiences dramatically lower temperatures than normal.

The Queen also allowed the faction ruler of Azoranthium to become the Prince of Azoranthium with her blessing.

Seeing the gods’ influence as detrimental to the good of the world, she outlawed all worship of anyone but herself, the Queen, and the thirteen demigods. Under these terms, anyone seen to have an amulet to Lathander, or to be openly praying to any other deity, would be thrown in jail until they rejected their worship of those deities.</p><p>Thallan also readily embraced a growing population of undead in her kingdom. She created laws that protected vampires and liches from those that might slay them, as well as making sure that their undead servants–so long as they weren’t harming anyone–could be out in public without fear of being attacked.</p><p>With the help of having the undead in her favour, she sparked fear in the hearts of any who would oppose her, allowing her to enact other laws of totalitarian nature, such as implementing security cameras, under-the-skin chips that are required at birth that would track the movements and health of all individuals, and robotic guardsmen that she had developed to ensure peace across the kingdom’s cities.</p></div><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>Totara</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>Totara, the desert kingdom, had always stayed out of trouble with the Queen and its own people. They were very accepting of outsides into their harsh lands, lead by a ruler by the name of Xythian Rarazydin, one of the grandchildren of the Queen herself. Xythian’s moral code throughout his rule had always been to ensure everyone had just enough to survive–and more if they could ever afford it.</p><p>His faith centred around worshiping the Demigods and all the territory in their kingdom. Each grain of sand was precious, each oasis was a blessing, the plants, animals and other beings that could survive–the few that could–were kin and spiritually connected to each other. They all knew they had come from the Book of Creation in some ancestry, leaving Xythian and his tribesmen to feel as if they were all family with all others on the planet.</p></div><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>Akiira</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>Akiira was left in ruins after the War of the Five Elves.

Not only that, but countless other spells were used to try and combat the artefact’s power, to no avail, scarring the land with various powerful magics made out of desperation.</p><p>Today, Akiira is but a chaotic land of anarchy, home to treasure hunters and glory seekers who wish to go into the wilds and overrun towers to retrieve items of old and fight beasts that have become corrupted by the land’s magic. Few have managed to set up a “city” of protection for incoming adventurers. This city, named Kamimagi, became a home to those who dare to challenge the wild lands of Akiira whenever they’re preparing for expeditions. The city is surrounded with an anti-magic wall to prevent the creatures of the corrupted land from attacking the city.</p><p>All must be careful, however, as all the corrupted magical land has made a perfect home for portals to other planes. A common traveler through Akiira might find themselves in the Shadowfell one day, escape back to Akiira, and then get stolen away to the plane of Mechanus before they’re able to leave the once glorious kingdom. The only safe place on Akiira from this is Kamimagi.</p></div><h3>Arcadia</h3><p><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">Though Akiira was largely seen as incapable of being salvaged, and the main island remained as such due to the serious magical corruption it endured, a new nation was founded on the second of Akiira's islands, east of Sarille. A collective of cities joined together to rebuild their infrastructure and population, clean up the ruins and rebuild from the ashes, to exceptional success. Constructing a new government and a council to look after it, the kingdom of Arcadia was formed, with technological innovation as its basis to ensure that its society would always keep moving forward and continue to better not just the newborn nation itself, but also the rest of the world.</span></p><p style=\"box-sizing:border-box;user-select:text;margin:0.5em 0px;min-height:unset;color:rgb(25, 24, 19);font-family:Signika, sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-variant-ligatures:normal;font-variant-caps:normal;font-weight:400;letter-spacing:normal;orphans:2;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px;text-decoration-thickness:initial;text-decoration-style:initial;text-decoration-color:initial;text-align:start\"><span style=\"font-family:Signika, sans-serif\">The Queen, who had written off the ruins of Akiira as a lost cause, was impressed by the nation's ability to persevere in the aftermath of the war and allowed the nation to retain autonomy and its unique government structure. The Council of Experts would run the new kingdom, headed by a Chief Technologist to ensure everything would run smoothly from then on.</span></p><p>Arcadia's rise from the ashes of Akiira's eastern continent allowed it to quickly form as a centre of technological advancement. The International Trade Organization was founded in Arcadia's capital, and quickly allowed the kingdom to modernize and digitize the currencies across all the kingdoms. Additionally, in contrast to Sarille's fully robotic workers and soldiers, Arcadia used its technological innovations in fusing technology and mortal life together to create a budding population of androids and cyborgs that integrated into society with open arms.</p><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>Dekatreis</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>After the War of the Five Elves, the Queen decided to put one of her children in charge of the land. The first ruler post-war was named Adrian Stormchild. He ruled justly and became responsible to inhabiting much of the mountainous ranges of Dekatreis, finding that they were just as suitable for cities as the forests were. He even moved the capital to where it stands still hundreds of years later.</p><p>After some years of rule, Adrian has his life saved during a battle with a ferocious red dragon by a powerful griffon. The strength and magical power of the beast gained Adrian’s respect tenfold, and in return for saving his life, Adrian pushed into law that griffons were to from thereon be considered sacred animals in the realm of Dekatreis, not to be hunted or attacked unless in self-defense.</p><p>The griffon that saved Adrian then re-found the Dekatrian ruler and declared that his name was Antheia, and that what Adrian did had gathered the powerful griffon’s adoration. As the sacred animals of Dekatreis, Antheia offered the service of griffons should the royalty of Dekatreis ever require protection, which Adrian accepted. In addition, the griffon granted Adrian a boon, a portion of his magic, turning Adrian into the first Griffonblood Sorcerer.</p><p>Adrian’s bloodline from there on gained the name Griffonblood, and the griffons remained royal to the Griffonbloods.</p><p>The current two rulers of Dekatreis are Adrian’s daughters, Rasha and Zella Griffonblood, who seek to push freedom and happiness for their people before anything. They set up an adventuring guild after reports declared that there was not enough work in the kingdom to keep families with a stable income. The adventuring guild was named the “House of Tessera,” and networks were made with help of the princesses to establish guilds in all cities of Dekatreis.</p><p>Along with the House of Tessera, Zella opened the princess’ tower to the public, allowing any and everyone to come bring their issues to the princesses whenever they wished, and the princesses would listen and try to resolve issues as they could. This gained widespread positive opinion and allowed their people to prosper with the ever-evolving help of the princesses.</p></div>","markdown":""},"_id":"Ox11ew3xCpkT1u7h","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":200000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.U9ffTjIQKQQ5cBP3.JournalEntryPage.Ox11ew3xCpkT1u7h"}},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":"12.324","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null,"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null}},{"name":"Adventure Timeline","type":"text","title":{"show":false,"level":1},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2>The Creation Years</h2><p>[KM] Kingmaker - 574 DY</p><h2>The Queen's Years</h2><p><strong>The Queen Ascends - 0 QY</strong></p><p><strong>War of the Five Elves - 141 QY</strong></p><p>[TLN] The Long Night - 304 QY</p><p>[DF] Dragonfall - 873 QY</p><p><strong>Split of Azor and Azoranthium - 906 QY</strong></p><p>[EotF] Eclipse of the Fallen - 910 QY</p><p>[EotA] Echoes of the Abyss - 936 QY</p><p>[AoH] Autumn of Heroes - 949 QY</p><p>[WoD] Wrath of Dragonkind - 967 QY</p><p>[SKT] Storm King's Thunder - 967 QY</p><p>[LMoP] Lost Mines of Phandelver - 990 QY</p><p>[OotA] Out of the Abyss - 991 QY</p><p>[OHT] Of Honour and Tyranny - 999 QY</p>","markdown":""},"_id":"e3x8i4cDHXDdWRcq","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":250000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.sSqxb3KWtSBIgnNw.JournalEntryPage.e3x8i4cDHXDdWRcq"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"5.4.4","coreVersion":"12.324","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1694149758501,"lastModifiedBy":"Ip5sxjIRA2aGUX04","compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null}},{"sort":0,"name":"Statistics","type":"text","_id":"a06unIizCwFGZY5X","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2>The World of Dekatreis</h2><section class=\"traits\"><p>WORLD</p><p>MONARCHY</p></section><p>A world that was once nothing more than ocean and sparse islands, that became terraformed and populated by The Original 13, a set of 13 self-proclaimed \"Demigods\" who set out to build their own world from scratch.

Where metallic dragons are wise and protective, chromatic dragons are often seen as cunning predators who value their hoards of land. However, it's not unheard of for chromatic dragons to be cooperative with other dragonkind or humankind, so long as their goals align.</p><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"width:20%\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Name</span></strong></span></p></td><td style=\"width:20%\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Type</span></strong></span></p></td><td style=\"width:20%\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Damage Type<br /></span></strong></span></p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Red</p></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Chromatic </p></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Fire </p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>White</p></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Chromatic </p></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Cold </p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Blue</p></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Chromatic </p></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Electricity </p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Green</p></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Chromatic </p></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Poison </p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Black</p></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Chromatic </p></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Acid </p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Purple</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Chromatic</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Mental</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Gem Dragons</h2><p>Gem dragons are a unique type of dragon, often known for intense isolation from humankind—even moreso than chromatic dragons—yet they're not completely unwilling to take visitors, they're just rarely the ones that will reach out first. While rarely aggressive, they are intensely protective of their hoarding of wealth and are usually distrusting of adventurers, who they instantly accuse of attempting to take from their hoard.</p><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"width:20%\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Name</span></strong></span></p></td><td style=\"width:20%\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Type</span></strong></span></p></td><td style=\"width:20%\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Damage Type<br /></span></strong></span></p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Obsidian</p></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Gem </p></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Fire </p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Sapphire</p></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Gem </p></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Mental</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Topaz</p></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Gem </p></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Void </p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Crystal </p></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Gem </p></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Force</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Quartz</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Gem</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Cold</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Sky Dragons</h2><p>Sky dragons are the most common to interact with smaller creatures, often deferring interactions with other dragonkind so that they can cooperate better with humankind. Whether it be out of curiosity for the vast societies that humankind can create, or for mutual benefit such as acting as mounts for facilitating trade in return for coin, it's clear that sky dragons hoard one thing over all: Connections between themselves and people.</p><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"width:20%\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Name</span></strong></span></p></td><td style=\"width:20%\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Type</span></strong></span></p></td><td style=\"width:20%\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Damage Type<br /></span></strong></span></p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Cloud </p></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Sky </p></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Bludgeoning (water) </p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Storm</p></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Sky </p></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p> Electricity</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Steam</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Sky</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Fire</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Mist</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Sky</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Mental</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Imperial Dragons</h2><p>Imperial dragons are the most well-versed and far-reaching of influence across dragonkind and are often the subject of diplomacy between different members of dragonkind. Where metallic dragons hoard knowledge and sky dragons hoard personal connections, imperial dragons hoard influence, ensuring that their deep insight into dragonkind and humankind that they collect can be used at any given time to maintain their status and power over others.</p><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"width:20%\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Name</span></strong></span></p></td><td style=\"width:20%\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Type</span></strong></span></p></td><td style=\"width:20%\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Damage Type<br /></span></strong></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Sovereign</p></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Imperial</p></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Mental</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Noble</p></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Imperial</p></td><td style=\"text-align:center\"><p>Sonic</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Forest</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Imperial</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Poison</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Underworld</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Imperial</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Fire</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Ocean Dragons</h2><p>Ocean dragons are unique in many ways, often operating completely separately from dragonkind and humankind together, and because of this it's not unheard of for most of humankind to not even know an ocean dragon when they see one. Hidden away in the depths of the seas and oceans across Dekatreis, very few people know what they hoard, but scholars and aquatic members of humankind who are able to meet an ocean dragon—and escape—can eventually depart with the discovery that they hoard probably the most disturbing thing of all: Other creatures.</p><p>From establishing underwater zoos to taking curious humans that they run into, blessing them with the ability to breathe underwater, and dragging them far down below the surface, scarcely giving them a choice in the matter, scholars who know about ocean dragons rarely recommend delving too deep into the sea, to prevent being added to an ocean dragon's hoard.</p><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"width:20%\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Name</span></strong></span></p></td><td style=\"width:20%\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Type</span></strong></span></p></td><td style=\"width:20%\"><p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Damage Type<br /></span></strong></span></p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Brine</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Ocean</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Acid</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Sea</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Ocean</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Bludgeoning (water)</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Abyssal</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Ocean</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align:center\">Void</p></td></tr></tbody></table>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1,"bNGcWgDxnepnLOmS":3,"Ip5sxjIRA2aGUX04":3},"flags":{"core":{"sheetClass":"","sourceId":"JournalEntry.7tXx07vSNr4AbrWE.JournalEntryPage.jSEt0CAZJfcGnYON"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"5.5.3","coreVersion":"12.324","createdTime":1693933744485,"modifiedTime":1695608291063,"lastModifiedBy":"Ip5sxjIRA2aGUX04","compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null}},{"sort":0,"name":"- Kobolds","type":"text","_id":"KZdZ3AbR4gSdY6hL","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<div class=\"flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3 max-w-full\"><div class=\"min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-3 overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><div class=\"empty:hidden\"><p>Kobolds are small, humanoid dragon-like creatures that had just a tiny fraction of draconic essence in them. They can be split into the same categories as dragons can, between metallic, chromatic, gem, imperial, sky, and ocean.</p><h2>Kobold History</h2><p>In the past, they were completely subservient to the dragons as if they were deities themselves, much like humankind worshiped the divines that walked the earth at the time.</p><p>Even after the humanoids' divines left following the Departure of the Demigods era, the kobolds kept the tradition of worship and servitude for much of their existence. This was especially the case well into the Queen's Years across Akiira as well as Azor, where kobolds were both used to serve the kingdoms and to maintain a strong connection between humanoids and dragons. Elsewhere, across the other kingdoms, kobolds were seen as little more than draconic pets or, sometimes, pests to humankind.</p><p>However, in Akiira and Azor, kobolds played a vital role in society; their unwavering loyalty to the dragons and their deep-seated reverence for these powerful beings made them invaluable as intermediaries between the dragonkind and humanoids. They served as emissaries, diplomats, and caretakers of dragon lairs.</p><p>Eventually, even outside of Akiira and Azor, they proved to not be just subservient creatures; they were also the keepers of ancient draconic knowledge. They meticulously recorded the wisdom and histories of dragons, preserving the lore of their kind for generations to come. This knowledge exchange enriched the culture of the continent, allowing all to benefit from the deep insights of dragonkind.</p><p>During the War of the Five Elves, many kobolds across Akiira, like dragons, were left confused, split, and eventually went in many different directions. Some kobolds were stolen away from elven society by their dragon sovereigns, either as protection or to ensure their assets weren't damaged in elvenkind's chaotic violence.</p><p>Other kobolds were left behind as the dragons that once looked after them fled the continent to somewhere safer, never to return. From these kobolds, many either made tribes, banding together for safety, or joined the remainder of humankind after the War of the Five Elves ended, integrating into human society and helping rebuild from the ruins.</p><h2>Modern Kobolds</h2><p>In modern days, the kobold tribes that stayed under the rule of dragons during the War of the Five Elves are still subservient in many ways to the ones that remain, but rather than the entire species being used as tools for dragonkind as they were in the past, many who were abandoned by their dragon sovereigns stand as equal citizens in Arcadia, respected for their contributions to society. Some kobolds hold prominent positions in Arcadia's day-to-day life, serving as scholars, historians, diplomats, and even adventurers, while others prefer to stay strictly to kobold society, building tribes and villages outside of the human ones but still doing trade and collaborating with humankind for mutual benefit.</p><p>Outside of Arcadia, however, kobolds are still often seen as mischeveious at best and a sign of trouble at worst if they're not serving a dragon. Humankind regards the common kobold with suspicion unless they have already made a name for themselves in the area, and even then, first impressions will often be off to a rocky start.</p><p>Despite this, almost all kobolds across all kingdoms still maintain their ancient traditions and continue to worship dragons. This connection to dragonkind remains a cornerstone of their identity, but some kobolds since the War of the Five Elves have began to wholly reject dragons as their superiors and instead flock to humankind's societies and deities instead, in an attempt to find better purposes in life or make a more unique identity for themselves. This, however, is still the minority, and several kobold tribes still gather around and dedicate themselves to a dragon in the area as well as protecting them and their hoard.</p></div></div></div>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1,"bNGcWgDxnepnLOmS":3,"Ip5sxjIRA2aGUX04":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.7tXx07vSNr4AbrWE.JournalEntryPage.KZdZ3AbR4gSdY6hL"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"5.5.3","coreVersion":"12.324","createdTime":1693834625130,"modifiedTime":1695608334734,"lastModifiedBy":"Ip5sxjIRA2aGUX04","compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null}},{"sort":75000,"name":"- Alepou and Kitsune","type":"text","_id":"3akGct1YSjsDr1qC","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1,"Ip5sxjIRA2aGUX04":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"5.5.3","coreVersion":"12.324","createdTime":1693958883462,"modifiedTime":1695608351222,"lastModifiedBy":"Ip5sxjIRA2aGUX04","compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null}},{"sort":-200000,"name":"- Humans","type":"text","_id":"GmAJLM9xNQn9wUVj","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1,"Ip5sxjIRA2aGUX04":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"5.5.3","coreVersion":"12.324","createdTime":1693958888879,"modifiedTime":1695608612350,"lastModifiedBy":"Ip5sxjIRA2aGUX04","compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null}},{"sort":-100000,"name":"- Elves","type":"text","_id":"WP32AnVErDt2ekvV","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1,"Ip5sxjIRA2aGUX04":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"5.5.3","coreVersion":"12.324","createdTime":1693958892267,"modifiedTime":1695608319741,"lastModifiedBy":"Ip5sxjIRA2aGUX04","compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null}},{"sort":100000,"name":"- Vishkanya","type":"text","_id":"tmJ6QgD5qerEP5h4","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<p>The Vishkanya trace their lineage to Keishara, one of the 13 Demigods who asked for her people to be made through the Book of Creation at the beginning of the world. Afterwards, the Vishkanya began to create what is now known in history as the ancient city of Zhyl'tzor, an old word for \"City of Inspiration.\"</p><p>It is said that they were gifted artisans, renowned for their intricate craftsmanship and unparalleled creativity. These skills were not only a source of pride but also a means of spiritual expression, tying them deeply to the natural world alongside the veneration of Keishara herself.</p><p>Over time, as they began to spread out and interact with other races, misunderstandings arose. Their venomous abilities, preference towards keeping to themselves and distinct appearance led to unfounded fears and misconceptions. To protect their way of life, many Vishkanya chose seclusion, preferring to interact only with those who showed genuine interest in understanding their culture.</p><p>Vishkanya craftsmanship is unparalleled. Their creations are not merely objects; they are reflections of their skills and a conduit to their prowesse, something more than simply something to be sold. Each piece tells a story, weaving together elements of nature, spirituality, and profound emotion. Their artistry spans a wide range, from delicate jewelry adorned with gemstones to grand sculptures that seem to breathe with life. It's for this reason that many hold their deep secrets, to prevent other people from stealing their formulas and making lesser works that attempt to replicate the Vishkanyan arts, yet without the true heart of what makes them so special.</p><p>Many outsiders misunderstood Keishara and to this day many misunderstand the Vishkanya. Some believed her to be malevolent, a perception rooted in fear and ignorance, and this can be applied to people's perceptions of her people as well. In reality, Keishara was a beacon of wisdom, guiding her people towards enlightenment and self-discovery. Her teachings emphasized harmony with nature, self-expression, and the importance of understanding one's own inner light.</p><p>For those who take the time to know them, Vishkanya are fiercely loyal and deeply compassionate. Once trust is established, they form bonds that are as enduring as the mountains that surround their secluded enclaves.

In charge were two of the Queen’s sons, Rose and Thorn Azorblood. The beginning years were grand; the resources of North Azor and the closeness to Sarille allowed a quick-paced embrace of technology. A strong relationship rose and allowed them to be second-best in development until the War of the Five Elves, where fear of getting dragged into the war forced the twins to temporarily suspend ties with Sarille.</p><p>From there, tensions began to grind between Rose and Thorn over how to settle unrest in South Azor. The immediate suggestion was to have one move to rule over the sister continent, yet with the distance and Sarrile’s war constricting their supplies necessary for development, neither wished to be the one to take up the risk. This eventually lead to a duel between the two, ending in the accidental death of Thorn at the hands of his sister.</p><p>As word of her brother’s murder spread and more calls of South Azor to be fixed, Rose eventually stepped down and put her daughter, Rosalia II, in charge. Rosalia was assassinated during a violent protest that attacked the tower, and the throne went to her next daughter, Rosalia III, right as the War of the Five Elves ceased.</p><p>The third Princess to rule over the kingdom of Azor, with no other options to settle her kingdom, put her foot down and began to make sweeping changes in every civillian’s life. From the farthest east to the farthest west, she declared that with Sarille’s new government registration technology, she would have every single citizen forcefully registered and kept track of. Security cameras, high-tech doors, and guard constructs were imported in mass now that ties with Sarille could be mended, and total rulership with an iron fist was the absolute for Azor.</p></div><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>Rosalia Azorblood IV</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>At the age of 435 after ruling for centuries, Rosalia III passed away, and her eldest daughter, Rosalia Azorbook IV, took the throne. Being taught by her mother in dominance and rulership, she kept the strong relationship with Sarille but wavered when it came to controlling her people. In many areas she lightened restrictions, such as requiring facial recognition, until an uprising in South Azor during the year 906 QY called her attention. She received word that her brother, Pavlos Azorblood, had claimed himself as Prince of the newfound kingdom of Azoranthium and separated all ties to Azor. To rebuke this, she acted fast and declared war: The Azorian Empire against the rebel nation of Azoranthium. The name change would be temporary, until they could reunify the lands.</p><p>However, as she re-implimented facial recognition and harsher security to track down those would seek to terrorize and speak out against her, she easily saw she couldn’t win the war. Azoranthium, without her knowledge, had began to create mass fleets of warships that were superior to the ships that she could produce, and Sarille refused to step into another war as Thallan Presthana had promised to not get into another conflict in the years before. Thus, she was alone at a stalemate, knowing she couldn’t properly attack but her defenses were bolstered due to the trade partnership with Sarille.</p><p>Within the same year the war started, the Queen called Rosalia and Pavlos to her court and settled the matter after hearing both sides. Knowing there would truly be nothing agreeable between all parties, she simply did what was best for both lands and announced that Pavlos could maintain his position of Prince of Azoranthium, officially allowing the first new kingdom to the world. She warned that the war would not be re-started without consequences, and left the two siblings to their rulerships on opposite sites of the world.</p><p>Since then, Rosalia has held an intense hatred of her brother and Azoranthium, seeing their progress and relations with Dekatreis as well as Totara as the biggest mistake in her rulership, constantly a reminder that she couldn’t hold up to her mother.</p></div>"},"_id":"IKhDFK8lN7InVhec","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":300000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":"12.324","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null,"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Statistics","type":"text","_id":"UfMKpzHi6jwQcfXg","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2>The Kingdom of Azor</h2><section class=\"traits\"><p>KINGDOM</p><p>MONARCHY</p></section><p>Azor is kingdom on the northmost region of the planet, and its people are constantly under surveillance and fear of speaking out against the princess or the Queen.

Their ability to tap into the mountain ranges with their keen sight allowed them to uncover natural resources better than all the other kingdoms, building up quick technological and societal advancement in many ways. After being accused of hiding a Demigod artefact away from the other kingdoms and starting the War of the Five Elves by executing a Dekatrian spy, the kingdom began its descent into earning the ire of all those outside Sarille.</p><p>During the imprisonment by the Queen after the royal trial, a new ruler was chosen to rule the once-prosperous Dark Elf land. Many non-Dark Elves of the kingdom had during the war began to rally behind a woman named Thallan Presthana, and the influence over millions of followers enabled to Queen to justly pronounce Thallan as the new Princess of Sarille. After her coronation, Thallan began to rapidly shift the society, enabling its darker attitude rather than shun it. Necromancy was greatly encouraged to do jobs that would usually risk the lives of Sarille’s citizens, enabling mining operations to have much more prosperous endeavors.</p><p>Their already well-built technological infrastructure pushed Thallan to make the first national ID system, and with the help of the kingdom of Azor, she placed facial recognition on every single one of her construct guards and registered everyone who passed through Sarille’s cities into her database. The national ID system, in time, was adopted by other kingdoms, but the facial recognition was scorned by all but Sarille and what would become the Azorian Empire. Not only enabling necromancy and mass surveillance, Thallan pushed for full adoption of necromantic magics in her kingdom to be fully realised as a school of magic. Using the national system, she allowed people to consent to their body’s use after death to supply necromancers with, putting the raising of zombies in a much better light due to people not needing to harvest the corpses of the unwilling.</p></div><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>Thallan Presthana</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>Thallan gained dominant popularity over the non-Dark Elves of Sarille after coming from Akiira and promising an greater ruler, one that wouldn’t provoke needless battle and would send the whole kingdom into a greater realm of prosperity than they had even before the war. In time, she would reveal that she was born of another plane, and after traversing through the Shadowfell, she ended up learning of Dekatreis through a great being that passed onto her knowledge that would supply her rule. Her charismatic personality and inherent strength allowed her to assert rule over any who would dare question her, though she respected the Queen greatly.</p><p>Using necromantically raised servants for most things in her daily life and encouraging the same throughout all of Sarille, her rule manifests itself as ruthless and tactical, oversurging with wealth and propserity from the monopoly her kingdom has on raw materials. In addition, she has made much of the mineal work done in Sarille supplied by undead and constructs. She maintains support by offering high quality social services funded by the kingdom directly, everything from shelter, medicine, and entertainment, as well as practicing regular public appearances through events and games to give her plenty of direct interaction with her populace.</p><p>Her biggest supporters, however, seem to come from the intelligent undead that are labelled as a protected minority under the Sarille government. From liches to vampires, the bordering kingdoms of Dekatreis and Totara both vocally disagree with the rampant unnatural extensions of people’s lives, even though she readily assures that the undead of her kingdom are “good-natured” and that they are closely regulated.</p><p>In addition, Thallan has plentiful enemies in the forms of worshipers of non-Demigods. A few hundred years after she began ruling, she had laws put into place banning all non-Demigod worship except for herself. Years after that, she also placed into effect a law that forced every school to teach worship of Thallan Presthana as divine-blooded. Gathering a plentiful amount of worshipers, whether out of true reverence or merely fear, Thallan placed herself beside her mother and directly below all the Demigods as the most worshiped entity in Sarille.</p></div>"},"_id":"A77Bnup8oBFG4yUP","image":{},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"sort":300000,"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":"12.324","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null,"compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null}},{"sort":200000,"name":"Statistics","type":"text","_id":"8PaD2Hk5scDGJIxE","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h2>The Kingdom of Sarille</h2><section class=\"traits\"><p>KINGDOM</p><p>MONARCHY</p></section><p>Sarille is a necropolis in the truest of definitions.

Sensing it, Vondal formed the continent that would become Akiira, and Kavara populated the place with all sorts of experimental creatures. From the sun and moon elves, long extinct back on Toril, to the were-beasts and several species of draconics and monstrosities. Magic flowed easily from the Book of Creation, almost enticing its power to the land itself.</p><p>During the rule of the Queen, Akiira was quickly overpopulated by the Sun and Moon Elves first and foremost, and people from other kingdoms migrated there using ships to explore the vast, magically-excited lands for themselves, in awe of how bright and colourful everything seemed. Every flower had life to it greater than anything seen on the other continents, and the people seemed more innately skilled at the arcane and psionic. It rose to become a grand centre of magical research during the Queen’s reign, enticing them to forge a pact between Dekatreis and Sarille to share magical knowledge so that all may benefit. However, this same pact seemed to become their downfall, as upon accusation that Sarille’s prince was hiding an artefact from the other two nations, chaos broke loose.</p><p>The War of the Five Elves showed the raw force of the Akiiran people, easily taking down Sarille’s armies of dark elves with Dekatreis moving in on the other side. The victories for Akiira, however, fell short once the the Apple of Discord was used to corrupt and ravage the minds of the people, enticing them to slay the Sun and Moon elves to absolutely devastate their war efforts. In the end, it was complete genocide of the two races, and by the time the war had come to a close, Akiira had been cursed by its own magic.</p><p>No one seemed safe in the lands. Magical beasts couldn’t think straight, attacking any life that moved. Increased potency of magical chaos in the land allowed such beasts to be granted immense magical abilities to carry out their attacks, and spells could hardly be considered stable either. The Akiiran cities were brought to ruins in little more than a few years, and inhabitance would reduce to only the insane monsters, and the fearless adventurers seeking riches in the destroyed remnants of Akiira.</p></div><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>Anarchy of Akiira</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>With the genocide of the Sun and Moon Elves, Akiira was left without proper rulers, and it seemed impossible for the Queen to reign in control with the mess that the Apple of Discord had caused.

It would be open for research, exploration, and adventure, but it wouldn’t be inhibited by politics.</p><p>Even though there is no sole ruler in Akiira, somewhat of a large city formed over hundreds of years as adventurers passed through. The name of the city became New Sylvis, in recognition of the old Akiiran capital that had long ago fallen to chaos.

Unlike clerics, who must actively seek the favor of their deities through devotion and prayer, oracles have their connection with the divine bestowed upon them, often at the behest of the gods themselves. This sacred bond between mortal and deity shapes the way oracles are perceived and respected in this world.</p><div class=\"flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3 max-w-full\"><div class=\"min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-3 overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><div class=\"markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light\"><p>The divine beings of Dekatreis do not possess the ability to establish this connection first, the mortal—in some way—must establish it first. However, an oracle-to-be doesn't even need to have actively sought out this divine connection. It can be formed through many circumstances, such as a simple prayer in a time of need, an unsuspecting visit to a holy site, or even being born at a time where a god's presence is strong enough.</p><p>The common factor, however, is that no matter what, the mortal is in a position where a divine can take note of a powerful soul and influence it. Then, whether it was the intent of the oracle-to-be or not, the deity can then take charge if it deems the soul capable enough for it to be granted visions and divine power. But, this also comes with a cost: The burden of a curse. It is seen as a divine test, an assessment of the individual's worthiness to serve as a prophet and interpreter of the divine' will.</p></div></div></div><p>This curse is a testament to the gravity of their role as seers and interpreters of divine visions. It is a constant reminder of their sacred duty and the expectations placed upon them by the gods. The nature of these curses can vary widely, from physical afflictions to mental challenges, and they serve as a means of testing the oracle's resolve and faith.</p><p>Oracles are well-known as people who possess the ability to receive and decipher divine visions. These visions can come in dreams, waking moments, or trance-like states. Oracles are rare, well-respected, and they're sought out for their insights and interpretations of matters corresponding to their visions by the common people. As they further prove themselves, they are given more visions, and as they become more well-known, their words begin to carry great weight to the people around them, from influencing entire cities and, for the most powerful of oracles, even entire regions of their kingdom.</p></div></div></div>"},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1,"bNGcWgDxnepnLOmS":3,"Ip5sxjIRA2aGUX04":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.7tXx07vSNr4AbrWE.JournalEntryPage.aH2rLrz1W7nYYTeC"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"5.4.2","coreVersion":"12.324","createdTime":1693912439081,"modifiedTime":1693958597097,"lastModifiedBy":"Ip5sxjIRA2aGUX04","compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null}}],"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"5.4.2","coreVersion":"12.324","createdTime":1693957805485,"modifiedTime":1693958755816,"lastModifiedBy":"Ip5sxjIRA2aGUX04","compendiumSource":null,"duplicateSource":null},"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"Ip5sxjIRA2aGUX04":3}}

As such, she gave it to the High Elves and Wood Elves to allow for hundreds of years of prosperity and eager development. Quickly building up a structure to their capital city and welcoming all kinds of races, Dekatreis became a mixing pot for all kinds and enabled many developments that the Dark Elves of Sarille neglected or the Sun and Moon Elves of Akiira rejected.</p><p>After the War of the Five Elves, however, Dekatreis was then given to one of the Queen’s sons who grew particularly ambitious with wanting to help his people in the aftermath of the war.

Funding an adventurer’s guild named the House of Tessera, they enabled all kinds of people to find work throughout their kingdom, even helping set up locations in the most remote towns so that all of Dekatreis could have the chance to go out and adventure for work rather than be tied to menial tasks that could be better suited to constructs.</p></div><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>Rasha Griffonblood</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>Rasha is the more prominent of the two Griffonblood Twins.

Despite earning the ire of Sarille from doing so, the prosperity that came from the sea-specialized Azoranthium and the exports of necessary resources to Totara has enabled the kingdom of Dekatreis to earn a grand amount of wealth that sustains their free social programs such as healthcare and education.</p></div><h3 class=\"displayHeading\" data-v-9a87df3a>Zella Griffonblood</h3><div class=\"displayText\" data-v-9a87df3a><p>Though her voice is not heard as often, when she speaks her tone provokes silence over a large majority of her audience.

Most prominently, the once-restricted doors of the Griffonblood Tower have been opened for public entry for any to come and meet the Princesses and decry their issues.

The first inhabitants were dragonkind, aviankind, and specks of elvenkind who traveled by air during the reign of the demigods.</p><p>In time, the dragons and elves brought livestock and made civilisations in the mountains and across the plains of the continent, with the dragons by and large keeping to themselves and the elves doing the same. Living adjacent, but separate.</p><p>As they spread out across the land, it became clear that this shared continent could not be divided forever. The elves, who had always been in touch with the celestial mysteries, foresaw a future where unity among the various inhabitants could lead to unparalleled prosperity. The concept of living in harmony with dragonkind became a dream that many elves aspired to achieve.</p><h2>Pact of Unity</h2><p>In a momentous event known as the \"Pact of Unity,\" the Sun and Moon elves initiated discussions with the dragons. Over many years, representatives from both races met in neutral territories, seeking common ground. Through patient negotiation and shared visions of a brighter future, as well as assistance from @Compendium[dekatreis.deities.2MDgBqn77mL44lZH]{Kavara} to mediate and finalise the pact, they secured an alliance that allowed elves and dragons to live together in mutual respect and cooperation.</p><p>The terms of the pact were as follows:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Shared Wisdom:</strong> Dragons would share their ancient knowledge and wisdom with the elves, fostering a greater understanding of the world's mysteries.</p></li><li><p><strong>Protection and Guidance:</strong> Dragons would protect elven settlements from external threats, while elves would assist in the safeguarding of dragon hoards and territories.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cultural Exchange:</strong> Both races would engage in cultural exchange, enriching each other's traditions and lifestyles.</p></li><li><p><strong>Coexistence:</strong> Elves and dragons would live in close proximity, ensuring peaceful coexistence and collaboration on various endeavors.</p></li></ol><p>This historic pact gave birth to a new era of prosperity, with the Sun and Moon elves living alongside dragons in peace and harmony. Akiira, as it would come to be known, became a testament to the possibilities of unity among dragonkind and elvenkin.</p><h2>War of the Five Elves</h2><p>However, this harmony was not destined to last. In a tragic turn of events, a conflict known as the \"War of the Five Elves\" erupted from the continent of Sarille, and rapidly spread from there to Dekatreis and Akiira.</p><p>This war tore at the very fabric of Akiira, pitting elf against elf and threatening the dragons who had, for so long, lived peacefully among them. In their desperation to protect themselves and their territories, some dragons took to destroying those infected by the Apple of Discordia in the hopes of bringing the war to a swift end, while others were at a loss, unable to defend their homeland if they were attacking the kingdom's very people.</p><p>The war culminated in devastation and widespread ruin. Dragons, once revered as allies and guardians, turned against the elves in mass towards the end of the war, seeing them as a threat. The unity that had been forged over centuries shattered, and the once-thriving land of Akiira was plunged into turmoil.</p><p>By the time the War of the Five Elves had ended, the Sun and Moon elves were extinct, and the elven settlements in Akiira were barely recognisable.</p><h2>Kingdom of Arcadia</h2><p>After the chaos of the war, a group of wise and determined individuals emerged from the ashes. They recognized that the only way to progress were by enlisting help from dragonkind as a new kingdom rose from the ashes. First, what remained of any settlements pooled their resources and forged a new city, they rebuilt and they named themselves \"Arcadia.\"</p><p>Without Kavara in the world, and the dragons untrusting of a deal that may go sour should another incident like the War of the Five Elves happen, it took many, many years before any breakthroughs in communication between the dragons and the new kingdom of Arcadia could happen.</p><p>In that time, the dragons made their own societies in and around the mountains, though most became solitary and others flew to different continents altogether. By the time the budding new kingdom gained enough stability and managed to convince the remainder of the dragons to come hear them out, there were less than 50 dragons on the continent at all.</p><h2>Pact of Reconciliation</h2><p>However, as distrust wavered and the dragons and the leaders of the newly found Council of Experts came to agreements about the path forward, it seemed fruitful to talk about a new pact. One that would stand, even in the face of strife, and though the dragons were more isolated and kept to themselves, they still eventually came to terms with the fact that the continent needed mutual cooperation.</p><p>The dragons, taking notes from the smaller races that made up Arcadia, elected their own council that would speak for them, the Council of Wyrms. From there, the Council of Experts and the Council of Wyrms brokered a new pact, known as the \"Pact of Reconciliation,\" which sought to mend the rift between elves and dragons and establish a new era of cooperation. The terms of this pact were:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Acknowledgment of Past Mistakes:</strong> Both elves and dragons would acknowledge the mistakes made during the War of the Five Elves and work together to prevent such a tragedies from recurring.</p></li><li><p><strong>Shared Governance:</strong> The kingdom of Arcadia would be governed jointly by representatives from both races, ensuring equal voice and representation.</p></li><li><p><strong>Protection of Arcadia:</strong> Humankind and dragonkind would stand together to protect the kingdom from external threats, using their unique strengths to safeguard their shared home.</p></li><li><p><strong>Cultural Rebirth:</strong> Cultural exchange would be revitalized, allowing for the restoration and preservation and sharing of traditions between the two races as well as the cooperative nature that existed from before the War of the Five Elves.</p></li></ol><p>This time, the pact held, and the new kingdom of Arcadia emerged as a beacon of hope and unity. Dragonkind on the continent, once turned distrustful by the conflict, now once more worked side by side with humankind to create thriving and diverse societies. This pact has endured to the present day, allowing the people of Arcadia to live in peace, and it is a testament to the enduring power of cooperation and reconciliation.</p><h2>Modern Dragons in Arcadia</h2><div class=\"flex flex-grow flex-col gap-3 max-w-full\"><div class=\"min-h-[20px] flex flex-col items-start gap-3 overflow-x-auto whitespace-pre-wrap break-words\"><div class=\"markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light\"><p>In the current times of the kingdom of Arcadia, various types of dragons coexist with the kingdom's inhabitants, each group with its own unique traits, roles, and interactions.</p><p><strong>Gem Dragons:</strong> Gem dragons are known for their affinity with precious stones and minerals. They typically dwell deep within the mountains and caves, where they hoard and protect their treasured gems. In Arcadia, these dragons play a crucial role as sources of rare and valuable resources. They maintain peaceful relationships with the kingdom by providing gemstones for trade, which in turn fuels the economy and supports various magical industries.</p><p><strong>Metallic Dragons:</strong> Metallic dragons, known for their noble and benevolent nature, are often regarded as protectors and mentors within Arcadia. They watch over the kingdom's borders and defend against external threats. Additionally, they share their wisdom and knowledge with scholars and adventurers alike, helping to further the pursuit of education and enlightenment.</p><p><strong>Chromatic Dragons:</strong> Chromatic dragons are the more challenging group to integrate into Arcadia's society due to their inherently aggressive and territorial tendencies. While some still maintain a degree of isolation in the wild, others have joined the kingdom as guardians, ensuring that their destructive tendencies are channeled towards safeguarding Arcadia rather than threatening it. They are fiercely loyal to the kingdom, acting as powerful defenders against external threats.</p><p><strong>Sky Dragons:</strong> Sky dragons are revered for their aerial prowess and are often seen as the guardians of the kingdom's airspace. They maintain patrols over Arcadia, ensuring its protection from any airborne threats. Sky dragons also assist with transportation, offering their services as mounts or escorts for travelers and merchants.</p><p><strong>Imperial Dragons:</strong> Imperial dragons are the ancient and wise rulers of their kind. They serve as advisers and mediators within the kingdom. Their deep knowledge of history, diplomacy, and magic makes them invaluable to the Council of Experts, where they help shape the kingdom's policies and resolve internal disputes. Imperial dragons are often looked upon as wise counselors and mentors.</p><p>These dragons collectively contribute to Arcadia's strength and prosperity, and the Pact of Reconciliation continues to guide their interactions with the kingdom's inhabitants.
